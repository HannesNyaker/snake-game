# snake-game
A simple snake game in C++

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To view the code, open "main.cpp" found in the Snake_game folder.
2. To run the game, run the "Snake_game.exe" file in the Debug folder.
3. To slow down the game (if it moves too fast), use the Sleep function in the main (it's currently inside a comment so make sure to delete the comment slashes) and increase the time inside the Sleep function to whatever you prefer.

How to play:
1. Press the WASD keys to move up, left, down and right respectively. Press the X key to quit.
2. Eat a fruit to gain length and increase your score.
3. Try to get the highest score you can! You lose if you either run into yourself or a wall.
